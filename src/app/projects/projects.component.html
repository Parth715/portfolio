                <p>This is my capstone project that I completed during bootcamp. It is a Purchase Request System that allows you to buy 
                    certain items subject to manager approval. If you would like to check it out click <a href="http://parpate1.w32.wh-2.com/PRSF" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Type in 1 for 
                    username and 1 for password.

                    This is my 3 Card Poker replica. Still working on the betting part but the functionality 
                    works. The capability of setting up multiple app pools is limited by my server; however, if you reach out to me
                    I can set up this project for use. Currently the Purchase Request System is up. Click 
                    <a href="http://parpate1.w32.wh-2.com/3_Card_Poker_F" target="_blank">HERE</a> to play 3 Card Poker.
